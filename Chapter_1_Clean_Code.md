## Why Clean Code?

> You are reading this book for two reasons. First, you are a programmer. Second, you want to be a better programmer. Good. We need better programmers.
> 

더 나은 프로그래머가 되고 싶다.

## Goals

- We’ll be able to tell the difference between good code and bad code.
- We’ll know how to write good code.
- We’ll know how to transform bad code into good code.

## LeBlanc’s law: Later equals never

> We’ve all looked at the mess we’ve just made and then have chosen to leave it for another day. We’ve all felt the relief of seeing our messy program work and deciding that a working mess is better than nothing. We’ve all said we’d go back and clean it up later. Of course, in those days we didn’t know LeBlanc’s law: Later equals never.

## Clean code vs. Speed

> … all developers feel the pressure to make messes in order to meet deadlines. In short, they don’t take the time to go fast!
> 

> … The only way to make the deadline—the only way to go fast—is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.
> 

… 사실은, 코드를 클린하게 작성하는 것이 가장 빠른 방법일 수 있다!

## Then, what is `Clean Code` ?

### Broken Windows

> A building with broken windows looks like nobody cares about it. So other people stop caring. They allow more windows to become broken. Eventually they actively break them. They despoil the facade with graffiti and allow garbage to collect. One broken window starts the process toward decay.

### Indeed, many of the recommendations in this book are controversial.

- Clean code exhibits close attention to detail.
- … give the reader that “Aha! Of course!” as the issues and tensions are resolved in the revelation of an obvious solution.
- Clean code is code that has been taken care of.
- *Runs all the tests*
- *Contains no duplication*
- *Expresses all the design ideas that are in the system*
- *Minimizes the number of entities such as classes, methods, functions, and the like.*

### The ratio of time spent reading vs. writing is well over 10:1.

We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code.

⇒ **The Boy Scout Rule**: Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.

💡 **Can you imagine working on a project where the code simply got better as time passed?**

## ⚠️ 이 스터디가 당신을 클린 코드 마스터로 만들어주지는 않습니다…

마치 그림 잘 그리는 법 책을 읽는다고 바로 내가 금손이 될 수는 없는 것과 같습니다.

하지만… 많을 것을 같이 공부할 수 있어요! 😁 같이 열심히 해봐요!!! 화이팅!!!!
